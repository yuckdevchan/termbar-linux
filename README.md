# termbar-linux - depsless status bar for Linux
Linux port of termbar, an xterm status bar for cwm, or other wm (For OpenBSD version go to: https://github.com/gonzalo-/termbar).

This 'distro' of termbar replaces OpenBSD utility calls in `/termbar-linux` with commands which will *mostly* work on Linux systems.
